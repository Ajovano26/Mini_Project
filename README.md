Step 1: Install the latest version of PostgreSQL from the link https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads

Step 2: Once PostgreSQL is installed and set up, open the file labelled "SQL_setup" and run it in python 3(through jupyter notebooks, visual studio code or your favourite python 3 interpreter to use)

Step 3: Once "SQL_Setup" has finished running and the message "New Database Created" is displayed in the terminal, you are ready to open the file labelled "SQL_Vandelay_db". Please run it in python 3 (through jupyter notebooks, visual studio code or your favourite python 3 interpreter to use)
